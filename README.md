# TumorD
This is a simple computational method, utilizing a machine learning algorithm, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors, Principal Component Analysis, and several data science libraries, for tumor detection in ultra-low single-cell DNA sequencing data and further analysis that was created over the span of a summer internship with the National Institutes of Health and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The following project was completed on a jupyter notebook. 

Patient single-cell DNA sequencing data was provided by Simone Zacarria from CHISEL: https://github.com/raphael-group/chisel-data. Additional help and assistance was provided by mentors Mohammed El-Kebir and Leah Weber.
